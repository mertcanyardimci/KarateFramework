# Introduction to Karate Framework

Karate Framework is a powerful tool for API testing and automation.
It is open-source and based on the Cucumber framework, allowing for easy creation of readable and maintainable test scripts.

## Writing API Tests

Tests are written in a simple and expressive language called Gherkin syntax, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users.
The syntax follows the "Given-When-Then" format, where test scenarios are described in a human-readable format.

## Features of Karate Framework

Karate Framework provides built-in support for HTTP request/response handling, making it easy to perform API testing without additional libraries or tools.
It supports both REST and GraphQL APIs, allowing testers to interact with a variety of web services.
Features such as dynamic data-driven testing, parallel execution, and integration with CI/CD pipelines enhance the efficiency and scalability of test automation.
